# strat_success_correlation

strat_success_correlation is an exploration of the extent to which the success of a mean reversion strategy between major US equity stocks is shared across the market. This is not intended as a guide for investment, nor does it provide any hard statistical results, however it does identify a few very interesting patterns which warrant further exploration, and could potentiall (as I explain in the full writeup) yield practical applications.

In the future I am planning to transfer the article into a Medium blog post which will link to this Github page, but in the meantime I have kept all parts of my work, including code, graphs and writeup, in the repository.
