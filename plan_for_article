INTRODUCTION

What motivated me to investigate this: quant firms have been performing poorly recently, conventional wisdom is that certain strategies
go in and out of fashion over long periods of time (as more investors adopt them, profits are arbitraged away faster)

But this opens up the question: are the successes of particular strategies shared across multiple equities? If no, this would cast doubt
on the above idea

POTENTIAL PROBLEMS

Largest problem: most of the correlation between success of strategies will be down to the correlation between the price movements
themselves, this problem is increased by the fact that I filtered out companies with significant missing data, which meant the remaining
ones tended to be very large, blue-collar, so probably more correlated to market than the small, volatile stocks

To counter this problem, I also measured the correlation between the price movements, and compared these 2 sets of statistics. If strat
success more correlated than price, this implies that there is some 'shared strategy effect' throughout the stocks, i.e. even though the
prices move differently, the general strategy of trend following goes in and out of fashion across the whole set of stocks. If strat 
success less correlated than price, this implies the opposite, i.e. that the only reason that trend following success (or lack thereof) 
is shared across securities is because of the underlying similarity in their price movements

PROCESS

Stock selection: Quantopian's full ticker set, measure average dollar volume back to 2010, took highest 20%, and then scraped data from
yahoo finance, using forward fill for data with up to 5 empty cells, and dropping tickers with more than this. Left with ? stocks.
Rationale for removal: more volatile stocks could have periods of extremely variable returns, where no one strategy wins out over another,
this could skew results.

Saved this data to a csv file, then created an ABC Strategy with a backtest() function, and created an inheritance class Momentum (as a
particular type of strategy). Reason for doing this is that I wanted the option to create more strategies, but they could all share the 
attributes of their parent class Strategy, most crucially the backtest() function.

Momentum took inputs ticker_list, short_window, long_window. Brief explanation of how momentum strategy worked + why I chose to use it, 
and why the exact parameters didn't matter. Momentum had a method trading_signals (explanation of how this worked, i.e. long and short).

backtest() used trading_signals to generate DataFrame of non-compounded returns: assumed 1 dollar per day (why this made more sense?),
could then generate matrix of pairwise correlation coefficients between each of the stocks. Removed 1s, and plotted against each other, 
also calculated mean

RESULTS

means were very similar, indicating very little 'shared strategy effect'. Analyse graph, pick out outliers and patterns

APPLICATIONS

potential applications: the most interesting potential application of this would have been if strategies were much more highly 
correlated than prices, because this would mean that, if the average success of strategies had some modellable distribution, it would
be possible to predict which strategies would be successful in the future. talk briefly about the ways that portfolios can adjust
strategies if they are less successful, but this requires losing an amount before a position is scaled back, so is less than optimal.
Unfortunately, these were not the findings. it used to be the case that the generation of a new strategy gave it stellar returns, 
followed by a period of very poor (or even negative returns) as investors flocked to it, but these days there is so much competition 
and free flowing of information that this is rarely the case with strategies. Competitive advantage is generally found in novel data 
sources, and creative ways of implementing already established strategies, rather than the strategies themselves.

However, these findings could still be of practical importance to the investor: 

FURTHER INVESTIGATION

use more strategies, investigate over different asset classes. the method I used was effective to get a general idea of certain
patterns, but to draw any hard, statistically verifiable solutions, we would need to significantly alter the process. this was more of
an investigative piece.
